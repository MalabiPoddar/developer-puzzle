# Stocks coding challenge

## How to run the application

There are two apps: `stocks` and `stocks-api`.

- `stocks` is the front-end. It uses Angular 7 and Material. You can run this using `yarn serve:stocks`
- `stocks-api` uses Hapi and has a very minimal implementation. You can start the API server with `yarn serve:stocks-api`

A proxy has been set up in `stocks` to proxy calls to `locahost:3333` which is the port that the Hapi server listens on.

> You need to register for a token here: https://iexcloud.io/cloud-login#/register/ Use this token in the `environment.ts` file for the `stocks` app.

> The charting library is the Google charts API: https://developers.google.com/chart/
